				<p><img id="biopic" src="biopic.jpg" alt="Mollie Chacon Picture" width="180">Hi! My name is Mollie and I am currently in a 6-month web development program at the University of Denver. For the last 10 years I’ve worked in sales and account management and was primarily was responsible for seeking and maintaining robust client relationships within a wide variety of industries such as telecom, utility, leadership development and construction. While I was proficient in this field, over time I’ve realized that I need a more fulfilling career; one that is more suited to me and my personality. Because of my affinity for problem-solving, puzzles and logic problems, I’ve gravitated toward web development! I’m hoping my passion for process improvement, my keen eye for detail and my strong organizational skills will help me on this journey. I’m so very excited to see where this new path takes me. </p>

				<br>

				<p>I was born, raised and have lived most of my life in the metro Denver area of Colorado. I live in Englewood (the town where I grew up!) with my husband Fred and our cat Mow and dog Barkle. In my free time, I enjoy sewing, reading historical fiction and other novels, refinishing mid-century modern thrift store finds, muay thai kickboxing, training my dog to do tricks and working on all sorts of home and garden reno projects. My favorite TV shows are Game of Thrones, Modern Famiily, Grace and Frankie, Playing House, Sherlock, Downton Abbey and The Big Bang Theory. </p>
